About:
	isbFramework is an Actionscript 3 framework I created for convenient use while writing games for adobe flashplayer.
	The files inside my framework all begin with isb (my initials) for convenience of distiguishing what is part of the
	framework in imitation of the flixel framework's flx prefix. Many of the classes inside deal with blitting a technique
	which allows for greater control of graphics in a game versus using the built in display list elements. The classes were
	created by me while creating various games and have been refactored while the development of said games progressed.
	I make no attempt to claim that the framework is bug free, only that when I have found a bug in my framework I have
	worked to eliminate it.
